# Project archived

I no longer think this is a good approach or idea, I suggest you use either
[cowplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/index.html) or
[patchwork](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html).

Fixing the multiple issues of this package requires changes to ggplot2 that
are not going to happen.

So it is better to archive this project to avoid further confusion

If you still want access to this project, the last version is available at
the `archived` branch.
